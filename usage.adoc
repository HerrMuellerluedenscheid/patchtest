[[intro]]
=== Introduction

**Patchtest** is a test framework for community patches based on the standard
https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html[unittest] python module.
As input, it needs tree elements to work properly: a **patch** in mbox format
(either created with `git format-patch` or fetched from 'patchwork'),
a **test suite** and a **target repository**. In this document we use 'patchtest-oe',
a test suite containing checks targeted for the
https://www.yoctoproject.org/tools-resources/community/mailing-lists[openembedded-core] (
OE-Core, hereafter) mailing list corresponding to the
http://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/[OE-Core] target repository.

Patchtest can either run on a <<host,host>> or a <<guest,guest>> machine, depending on which environment
the execution needs to be done. If you plan to test your own patches (a good practice before
these are sent to the mailing list), the easiest way is to install and execute on your local
host; in the other hand, if automatic testing is intended, the guest method
is strongly recommended. Both methods are explained in the following sections.

One last thing, the terms *patch*, *mbox* and *series* are used in several parts of the document
but all mean the same: a code change (produced by diff or git) embedded in a mbox. Patchwork has
the 'series' abstraction (collection of patchtest) but at the end the series is fetched as a single
mbox and git-mboxes (produced by `git-format-patch`) are mboxes containing just a single patch.

[[prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

Make sure that your `$PYTHONPATH` contains bitbake's `lib/bb` path. This is required
for patchtest to find the `tinfoil` module.

[[host]]
=== Host execution
[WARNING]
Testing series coming from 'patchwork' without inspection may be risky on an insufficiently secured
environment; if that is the case, it is [red]#strongly recommended# to execute patchtest in a guest machine
as indicated on the <<guest, guest>> section.


* Clone repositories

NOTE: the following steps consider the 'OE-core' and its corresponding suite ('patchtest-oe')
as examples. Any other project/suite can be configured in a similar fashion.

[source,shell]
----
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest-oe
----

[[requirements]]

* Using 'pip', install the python requirements for both projects
[NOTE]
You can use your distribution package manager instead of 'pip' to install
such python requirements

[source,shell]
----
cd <path to patchtest>; pip install -r requirements.txt
cd <path to patchtest-oe>; pip install -r requirements.txt
----

* Test a patch (patch can be those produced by git-format-patch from the OE-core repository
or an standard mbox fetched from patchwork)

[source,shell]
----
patchtest <some OE-core patch> <path OE-core directory> <path to pachtest-oe test directory>
----

or providing a patch through the standard input

[source,shell]
----
cd <path to OE-core repository>
git format-patch -1 --stdout | patchtest - <path to patchtest> <path to /pachtest-oe/tests>
----

[[guest]]
=== Guest execution

This method is recommended when patch testing is done automatically (i.e. through a 'cronjob'). However,
if you want to test your own patches, the <<host,host>> approach is a better option for making the code
cycle faster ('code-test-code').

NOTE: The following commands assumes that 'patchwork/git-pw', 'patchtest' and 'patchtest/scripts' folders
are visible on '$PATH'

* Create the guest machine, specifying the directory where the guest machine will be located

[source,shell]
----
create-guest-machine -g $HOME/patchtest-guest
----

* Create the share folder, containing the repositories needed by 'patchtest' inside the guest machine


[source,shell]
----
create-share-folder -s $HOME/patchtest-share
----

* Launch the guest machine through the 'guest' script

NOTE: The 'guest' script execute the follow tasks: 1. fetch latest series 2. pull relevant
repositories 3. launch the `core-image-patchtest` guest machine, the later
tests every patch found on '$HOME/patchtest-share/mboxes' then halt automatically; at host, the
results are located at '$HOME/patchtest-share/results'.

[source,shell]
----
guest -g $HOME/patchtest-guest -s $HOME/patchtest-share
----

* The later command can be executed anytime, testing latest series since last
time the command was executed. Consecutive 'guest' runs store the later data inside '$HOME/patchtest-share/backup'
folder. Launching the guest machine can be done automatically through a cronjob and the following instructions
provide the proper setup through the system 'crontab' command

* Create the crontab file
[source,shell]
----
create-crontab -g $HOME/patchtest-guest -s $HOME/patchtest-share -c $HOME/patchtest-cron
----

* Allow the cron user to run the following scripts with sudo permissions

[source,shell]
----
<cronjob-user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /home/<cron user>/patchtest-guest/poky/scripts/runqemu-ifup
<cronjob-user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /home/<cron user>/patchtest-guest/poky/scripts/runqemu-ifdown
----

* Set the crontab file

NOTE: Cron executes (sources) the '$HOME/patchtest-cron/cronenv', so any environment variable to take
into account on the cronjob process can be added here, i.e. proxies

[source,shell]
----
crontab -u $USER $HOME/patchtest-cron/crontab
----

By default, the cron runs every half hour but any other interval can be set using the parameter '-f'.
The folders '$SHARE/mboxes' and '$SHARE/results' contain previous patchtest input/output data.
Consecutive crons backup the later data inside the '$SHARE/backup' parent folder.

[[pw]]
=== Patchwork Git configuration

New series can be fetched from a 'patchwork' instance using the patchwork `git-pw` tool. For the 'OE-core' project case,
set the following:

NOTE: The following commands assumes that 'patchwork/git-pw' and 'patchtest' folders are visible on '$PATH'

[[pw-project-config]]
[source,shell]
----
git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
cd openembedded-core
git config patchwork.default.url 'http://patchwork.openembedded.org'
git config patchwork.default.project 'oe-core'
----

Fetch and test in the same command line

[source,shell]
----
git pw mbox 1487 | patchtest - $PWD <patchtest-oe/tests>
----

[[scenarios]]
=== Secundary scripts and common scenarios

The script `patchtest` is the only script you would use in case you are testing a single
mbox and you do not really care about storing the results. These section cover others scripts,
secondary scripts, in the sense that these sit on top of `patchtest`,
that can help you the process of fetching mboxes from patchwork instance and/or
testing and collecting the results into repository.

NOTE: The following commands assumes that 'patchwork/git-pw', 'patchtest' and 'patchtest/scripts' folders are visible on '$PATH'

There are two main scripts

* 'fetch-mboxes': Fetch mboxes from a patchwork instance and place these into a output folder
* 'test-mboxes' : Test one or more mboxes, possible assembling these into into a git-branch and/or
                  storing results and logs into a target folder

[[fetching-series-from-patchwork]]
==== Fetching series from patchwork

In case you want want to fetch one ore more series from a patchwork instance, you can do it in several ways:

Fetching a particular series/revision:

[source, shell]
----
git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
cd openembedded-core
git config patchwork.default.url http://patchwork.openembedded.org
git config patchwork.default.project 'oe-core'
fetch-mboxes -r <openembeded-core repo> 2017.1
----

In the above command, if no revision is provided (no `.1`), it will take the latest revision.

Fetching mboxes since a timestamp (and stored into a specific folder)

[source, shell]
----
fetch-mboxes -r <openembedded-core repo> -m $PWD/mboxes -s 2016-08-31
----

Or fetch latest mboxes since last git-pw poll

[source, shell]
----
fetch-mboxes -r <openembedded-core repo> -m $PWD/mboxes
----

This last command has a side-effect: it uses the `git-pw` tool to poll new events, so the later
updates the timestamp file ('$REPO/git-pw.<project>.poll.timestmap'). As a result, this tool
can be used to fetch new patches that have arrived to the mailing list through a cronjob as
describe in the <<guest, guest>> section.

WARNING: if the 'git-pw.<project>.poll.timestamp' file is not represent, it will poll events but will
not produce any mboxes. This avoids fetching many mboxes which may be not the desired behavior.

[[testing-series]]
==== Testing series

Let's say you have some mboxes in a particular folder ('$PWD/mboxes') so you need to test them and store results into 'results'

[source,shell]
----
git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest-oe
test-mboxes -r $PWD/openembedded-core -s $PWD/patchtest-oe/tests -o $PWD/results $PWD/mboxes
----

The output directory 'results' contains raw patchtest results and logs.

[[fetching-testing-from-patchwork]]
==== Fetching and testing latest series from patchwork

As mentioned before, testing series automatically is not safe if done at host, but in case your
host is already isolated in some other way as explained in the <<guest, guest>> section, run
the following steps:

* Prepare the folder containing the repositories needed by patchtest

[source,shell]
----
create-share-folder $HOME/patchtest-host
----

* Every time you need to fetch and test latest series from the patchwork instance, run

[source,shell]
----
host -s $HOME/patchtest-host
----

The first time, it will just fetch all mboxes **without** testing them (otherwise, it may fetch lots of
mboxes which may not be desired), so real testing would happen after the second run and only if new
series have arrived into the patchwork instance. All results (and plain logs files) are stored into
'$HOME/patchtest-host/results' in `json` format.

[[assembling-mboxes]]
=== Assembling tested mboxes

Besides <<testing-series,storing results>>, one may be interested in assembling those patches
that have pass **all** tests into a particular branch:

[source,shell]
----
git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/patchtest-oe
test-mboxes -r $PWD/openembeded-core -s $PWD/patchtest-oe/tests -a patchtest-branch $PWD/mboxes
----

By default, the new branch created (`patchtest-branch` in this case) is checkout from `HEAD`, however one
can indicated another starting point with the parameter `-p`. If you want to merge the mboxes no matter
the test results, just include the parameter `-A` (inside the new branch, you will see some commits with
test failures). As in the `-o` case, the branch can be visited and commits review with standard
`git-log/show` where results are stored as `git-notes`.
